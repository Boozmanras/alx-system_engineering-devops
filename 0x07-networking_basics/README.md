## Scripts

- **2-MAC_and_IP_address**: Provides answers to questions about MAC and IP addresses.
- **3-UDP_and_TCP**: Provides answers to questions about UDP and TCP protocols.
- **4-TCP_and_UDP_ports**: Displays listening TCP and UDP ports along with their PID and program name.

Each script is executable and passes `shellcheck` without errors.
